# Pravega Benchmark Tool

The pravega benchmark tool used for the performance benchmarking of pravega stream storage.
This tool performs the throughput and latency analysis for the multi producers and consumers for pravega.
it also validates the end to end latency. The write and/or read latencies can be stored in the CSV file for later analysis.
At the end of the performance benchmarking, this tool outputs the 50th, 75th, 95th , 99th and 99.9th latency percentiles.


### Prerequisites

- Pravega client : https://github.com/pravega/pravega
- Java 8+

### Building

Checkout the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/pravega/pravega-benchmark
cd pravega-benchmark
```

check the pravega client version and add to build.gradle file

```
For example:
you may have pravega client version 0.5.0 in this folder:

ls /<home directory>/.m2/repository/io/pravega/pravega-client/
0.5.0-SNAPSHOT

add this version : 0.5.0-2064.d8dd7cb-SNAPSHOT  to <>/pravega-benchmark/build.gradle file as follows:
dependencies {

compile "io.pravega:pravega-client:0.5.0-SNAPSHOT",
"io.pravega:pravega-common:0.5.0-SNAPSHOT",
....
....
}
```

Build the pravega benchmark Tool:

```
gradle distTar
```

untar the pravega benchmark tool to local folder

```
tar -xvf ./build/distributions/pravega-benchmark.tar -C ./run
```

Running pravega bencmark tool locally:

## Running Performance benchmarking

The pravega benchmark tool can be executed to
 - write/read specific amount of events/records to/from the pravega cluster
 - write/read the events/records for the specified amount of time

The pravega benchmark tool can be executed in the following modes:
1. Burst Mode
2. Throughput Mode
3. OPS Mode or  Events Rate / Rate limiter Mode
4. End to End Latency Mode


### 1 - Burst Mode
In this mode, the pravega benchmark tool pushes/pulls the messages to/from the pravega client as much as possible.
This mode is used to find the maximum and throughput that can be obtained from the pravega cluster.

```
For example:
<pravega benchmark directory>/run/pravega-benchmark/bin/pravega-benchmark  --controller tcp://10.240.135.49:9090  --stream streamname1  -segments 1  -producers 1 -consumers 1  --size 100   -throughput -1   -time 60

The -throughput -1  indicates the burst mode.
This test will executed for 60 seconds because option -time 60 is used.
This test tries to write and read events of size 100 bytes to/from the stream 'streamname1'.
The option '--controller tcp://10.240.135.49:9090' specifies the pravega controller IP address and port number.
Note that -producers 1 indicates 1 producer/writers, -consumer 1 indicates 1 consumer/reader

in case you want to write/read the certain number of events use the --events option without --time option as follows

<pravega benchmark directory>/run/pravega-benchmark/bin/pravega-benchmark  --controller tcp://10.240.135.49:9090  --stream streamname1  -segments 1  -producers 1 -consumers 1  --size 100   -throughput -1   --events 1000000

--events <number> indicates that total <number> of events to write/read
```

### 2 - Throughput Mode
In this mode, the pravega benchmark tool pushes the messages to the pravega client with specified approximate maximum throughput.
This mode is used to find the least latency  that can be obtained from the pravega cluster for given throughput.
This mode is used only for write operation.

```
For example:
<pravega benchmark directory>/run/pravega-benchmark/bin/pravega-benchmark  --controller tcp://10.240.135.49:9090  --stream streamname5  -segments 5  -producers 5   --size 100   -throughput 10   -time 300

The -throughput <positive number>  indicates the Throughput mode.

This test will be executed with approximate max throughput of 10MB/sec.
This test will executed for 300 seconds (5 minutes) because option -time 60 is used.
This test tries to write and read events of size 100 bytes to/from the stream 'streamname5' of 5 segments.
If the stream 'streamname5' is not existing , then it will be created with the 5 segments.
if the steam is already existing then it will be scaled up/down to 5 segments.
Note that -producers 5 indicates 5 producers/writers .

in case you want to write/read the certain number of events use the --events option without --time option as follows

<pravega benchmark directory>/run/pravega-benchmark/bin/pravega-benchmark  --controller tcp://10.240.135.49:9090  --stream streamname5  -segments 5  -producers 1  --size 100   -throughput 10   --events 1000000

--events 1000000 indicates that total 1000000 (1 million) of events will be written at the throughput speed of 10MB/sec
```

### 3 - OPS Mode or  Events Rate / Rate limiter Mode
This mode is another form of controlling writers throughput by limiting the number of events per second.
In this mode, the pravega benchmark tool pushes the messages to the pravega client with specified approximate maximum events per sec.
This mode is used to find the least latency  that can be obtained from the pravega cluster for events rate.
This mode is used only for write operation.

```
For example:
<pravega benchmark directory>/run/pravega-benchmark/bin/pravega-benchmark  --controller tcp://10.240.135.49:9090  --stream streamname1  -segments 1  -producers 5  --size 100  -events 1000   -time 60

The -events <event numbers>  (1000 ) specifies the events per second to write.
Note that the option "-throughput"  SHOULD NOT supplied for this OPS Mode or  Events Rate / Rate limiter Mode.

This test will be executed with approximate 1000 events per second by 6 producers.
This test will executed for 300 seconds (5 minutes) because option -time 60 is used.
Note that in this mode, there is 'NO total number of events' to specify hence user must supply the time to run using -time option.
```

### 4 - End to End Latency Mode
In this mode, the pravega benchmark tool writes and read the messages to the pravega cluster and records the end to end latency.
End to end latency means the time duration between the beginning of the writing event/record to stream and the time after reading the event/record.
in this mode user must specify both the number of producers and consumers.
The --throughput option (Throughput mode) or --events (late limiter) can used to limit the writers throughput or events rate.

```
For example:
<pravega benchmark directory>./run/pravega-benchmark/bin/pravega-benchmark  --controller tcp://10.240.135.49:9090  --stream streamname3  -segments 1  -producers 1 -consumers 1  --size 100  -throughput -1   -time 60 -wr true

The option "-wr true" specifies write-to-read or End to End latency mode. it should be set to true.

The -throughput -1 specifies the writes tries to write the events at the maximum possible speed.
Note that, in this mode user must specify count of both producers and consumers.
```

### Recording the latencies to CSV files
user can use the options "-writecsv  <file name>" to record the latencies of writers and "-readcsv <file name>" for readers.
in case of End to End latency mode, if the user can supply only -readcsv to get the end to end latency in to the csv file.
